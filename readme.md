# iocage-plugin-homebridge

a basic homebridge plugin with the webui (homebridge-config-ui-x) setup.
The inital password/login for the webui is "admin/admin", please change it right away for security reasons.
The mac/pin required by homebridge is generated at the time of the installation randomly just for you.


I want to thank the following webpages/users for providing me pointers and hints to make this
possible:
